# Changelog

Arcade Link follows the frozen protocol v1 and manifest schema 1. Apps pin an
immutable tag; a new tag never changes the wire format.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-10

- Registers Arcade Shelf (`arcade.shelf`) and Arcade Find (`arcade.find`) in
  the Rust and Qt app metadata: names, pitches and releases pages, so
  Connected apps lists show both apps with a Get link before they are
  installed.
- Glyphs (`assets/glyphs/arcade.shelf.svg`, `arcade.find.svg`) and accents
  (Shelf `#94A8FF`, Find `#22C55E`) in `tokens.json`.
- SPEC catalog rows for `shelf.add`, `shelf.show`, `shelf.pick`,
  `find.search` and `find.show`, and the Find shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+F).
- Mock fixtures `fixtures/shelf.json` and `fixtures/find.json`, real-binary
  Shelf and Find groups in `tools/e2e.py`, and benchmark entries.
- No protocol, manifest or API changes: apps on `v0.1.0` keep working and
  talk to apps on `v0.2.0`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-08

- Protocol v1: registry, local transport, content matching, invocation,
  lifecycle and conformance, in Rust (`watch`, `engines` features) and the
  Qt module. Used by Box, Look, Lens, Clipboard, Wheel and Tools.
