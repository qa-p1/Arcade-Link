# Shared per-user Windows integration

Vendor `arcade.iss`, `arcade.nsh` and `arcade-integration.ps1` from the same
Arcade Link tag. Record the tag and SHA-256 of **each file** in the app's
`VENDORED`; verify those hashes in CI, as for `qt/`. The PowerShell helper is
embedded as an installer payload; it requires only Windows PowerShell 5.1.
No helper download or third-party PowerShell module is involved.

Both include paths install under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\<Name>`, create a
Start menu entry, offer unchecked desktop and start-at-login tasks (apps may
set their existing startup default), and write a CLI shim and atomic receipt.
Receipts live at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arcade\installs\<id>.json`, matching Link's
Windows registry root. Native helper files restrict the receipt ACL to the
user and SYSTEM; Unix `0600` has no literal Windows equivalent.

The helper preserves the existing HKCU `Environment\Path` value type and
unexpanded contents. The bin directory is added once, compared without case,
and a `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` broadcast follows changes. Other `.cmd` shims keep
the folder on PATH during uninstall. The last one removes just that entry.
Neither installer launches the app on a silent path. Neither needs elevation,
changes machine PATH, or bypasses SmartScreen.

Define these before including either file:

| Define | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `ARCADE_ID` | `arcade.find` |
| `ARCADE_NAME` | `Arcade Find` |
| `ARCADE_VERSION` | `0.3.0` |
| `ARCADE_EXE` | `arcade-find.exe` (filename under install dir) |
| `ARCADE_CLI` | `arcade-find` |
| `ARCADE_HOMEPAGE` (optional) | catalog homepage URL |
| `ARCADE_START_AT_LOGIN_DEFAULT` (optional) | `0` or `1` (default `0`) |

Names/values must be trusted compile-time strings without quotes or newlines.
Keep existing installer identities: Inno's optional `ARCADE_INSTALLER_ID`
defaults to `ARCADE_ID`; override it with the app's current `AppId`.

For Inno, include `arcade.iss`, then supply the app's `[Files]` and build
directives. Existing Pascal event handlers define `ARCADE_CUSTOM_EVENTS`
and call `ArcadeIntegration(True)` at `ssPostInstall` and
`ArcadeIntegration(False)` at `usUninstall`. `/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES
/NORESTART` uses the same integration; `/MERGETASKS=arcade-startup` or
`/TASKS=` chooses startup tasks. Runtime `/ARCADEMANAGEDBY=tools` and
`/ARCADECHANNEL=stable` carry receipt ownership/channel.

For Unicode NSIS 3, insert `ArcadeSetup` for metadata/per-user defaults,
`ArcadeTasks` **before the main application section**, `ArcadeInstall` after
the application's `File` statements, `ArcadeInitTasks` in `.onInit`, and
`ArcadeUninstall` before deleting application files. Add the components page
to show the optional tasks. `/S /STARTATLOGIN=0|1 /DESKTOPSHORTCUT=0|1` is
silent parity; `/ARCADEMANAGEDBY=tools /ARCADECHANNEL=stable` works here too.
The includes preserve settings and data; the app owns any explicit remove-data
choice and must not recursively remove a data-bearing install directory.

`samples/` provides minimal compilable callers and an isolated CI-account
verification script. The `windows-installers` CI job builds and runs both,
checks repeated installs, two simultaneous shims, metadata, receipts, and
last-one-out removal. This job has not been run locally on Linux.
